Overview
------------------
A Machine Learning project for predicting rainfall in Australia. 
The goal of this project was to develop and compare three different ML models (KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree) to find the best one. 
The models analyze a dataset containing meteorological data for a given day and predict whether it will rain the following day.

Technologies and Methods
------------------
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Data Preprocessing: feature selection, handling missing values, categorical encoding
- ML models: KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree
- Dimensionality Reduction: PCA
- Model optimization: Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search CV
- Evaluation: F1 score, ROC AUC, confusion matrix
